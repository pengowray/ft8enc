# FT8 Player by VK3PGO

**[FT8 Player](https://pengowray.github.io/ft8play/)** (`ft8play`) is an online tool to generate and visualize FT8 audio. It runs in a web page.

I made this webpage which will pack text into FT8, visualize it in various ways and play it as audio. I thought someone might find a use for it.

It will also take an encoded FT8 message (in whatever text representation you can throw at it) and give you a breakdown of the contents.

It uses FT8_Lib for decoding (which is also used by KiwiSDR and FT8CN), as well as custom code to extract additional message types and fields. It will also highlight CRC and LDPC errors. Everything runs in a web page (it doesn't send inputs anywhere). The source code is plain javascript. FT8_lib is written in C and I've compiled it to wasm (web assembly).

I don't have plans to add audio decoding at this stage, though I do keep pondering it and dreaming about building up a full QSO-capable app that would run on a phone's browser.

Any feedback welcome. Let me know if you find some use for it or want to help develop it.

## How it works

Enter a short message, press encode, see it encoded, play the FT8 audio on your speaker or into your radio transceiver if you like. Pick one of the pre-made messages (near the bottom) if you just want to test it out.

## What is FT8?

FT8 is a digital chat mode designed by Joe Taylor, the first human to ever notice a binary pulsar. The mode is popular with amateur radio enthusiasts who use it to fill the airwaves across the world with something that sounds like R2-D2 gargling. FT8 is a weak signal mode deisgned to be heard through a lot of noise. 

To transmit FT8 farther than the bluetooth speaker connected to your phone you'll need to become a ham radio licensee, which you can do by tricking the right people into believing you understand how photons really work. You'll also need a radio. If you're allergic to licensing requirements and buying radio hardware, you can listen to other people's online SDR radios and hunt down FT8 traffic, or you can try decoding ft8play generated audio in an app like WSJT-X or FT8CN.

**Splitscreen Test: Decoding FT8 Player's audio on an Android phone.** The FT8 audio is played on the phone's speaker by the [FT8 Player web page](https://pengowray.github.io/ft8play/). The FT8CN app picks up the audio again using the device's built-in microphone and decodes it.

## Who's this even for?
- Me. I wanted to see if it could be made. One must trust one's obsessions.
- Anyone interesting in learning about FT8
- Amateur radio folk who want to better craft or understand FT8 messages.
- Developers of FT8 software, who might appreciate the ability to quickly check the validity and content of codewords, symbols, hex or binary payloads, etc.
- The future. Eventually it would be fun to make a fully functional FT8 QSO app which runs in the browser, with logging and and CAT control for various radios (via the web serial API), but that's some way away.

## What things are in the UI

- Base Frequency (default 500 Hz). FT8 audio output will range from the base frequency to about 50 Hz above it. 1000 Hz is sometimes used as the default base frequency for certain applications, but 500 Hz is the default because it made for more pleasant listening while developing this.
- Sample Rate: the number of audio samples per second in your generated audio signal. 12000 Hz is the default. 44100 Hz is CD quality. If you set the base frequency to more than about half the sample rate, you'll get fun aliasing effects.
- "Play at Next 15s Slot" is an awkwardly named button which waits until the next FT8 window begins before playing audio. It's based on your device's clock. Please drop a message or a pull request if you know javascript and have a way of getting a precise time from somewhere on the internet (ala [time.is](https://time.is/)), or if you have an idea for a more consise name for this button.

## Message input formats

- A standard FT8 message such as CQ, signal report, acknowledgement. Example: `CQ AA9GO QF22`. If FT8_lib fails to encode the text as a standard message, then ft8play attempts to encode it as a free text payload. FT8_lib does not yet support certain FT8 message types such as DXpedition mode and contests. Click the example messages at the bottom of the page to test different messages. (Note: The preview release does not currently automatically fall back to free text so they need to be entered as below)
- `<FREE TEXT>`. The message you write between the `<` and `>` will be uppercased and truncated to 13 characters. Valid characters are ` 0123456789ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ+-./?`. You can send anything as free text in FT8.
- Telemetry data. Examples: `123456789ABCDEF012` `T:DEADCAFE`. Exactly 18 hexadecimal digits (first digit must be 0 to 7), or `T:` followed by 1 to 18 hex digits. 71-bits.
 
Payload/symbol input formats: (for debugging or advanced uses)
- FT8 payload as packed hex: Exactly 10 hexadecimal digits containing your 77-bit payload (zero-padded on the end, not the start). e.g. `5f a5 ec 39 30 6f aa c3 d6 00` Input may contain spaces or dashes between the bytes. This format is found in the output of gen_ft8, a command line tool which comes as source code in FT8_lib
- FT8 payload as packed binary string. 77 digits: Example: `00001100001010010011101110000000010011011110111100011010111010100001100110001` This is a format displayed by the WSJT-X utility ft8code.exe which calls it "Source-encoded message, 77 bits". Input may contain spaces. Also accepted: 91-bits (message + 14 bit CRC), 174-bit codeword (message + CRC + LDPC). Spaces are ignored.
- Symbols: Exactly 79 digits, zero to seven, representing the eight tones of FT8. For example: `3140652154634130077314147171333010263140652631713260022224072711662335223140652` Input may optionally contain spaces. This format is used within the output of both ft8code (wsjt-x) and gen_ft8 (ft8_lib). Perhaps someone is talented enough to edit the numbers into a melodic tune.

## Bugs
- You have to hit generate again after adjusting any audio settings.
- Memory usage likely increases with use

## To do
- [ ] decode FT8 audio
- [ ] fully support encoding and decoding of all ft8 message types
- [ ] have the UI suggest alternative encoding methods when available
- [ ] optimizations
- [ ] FFT visualization
- [ ] rework the UI
- [ ] lots of other things, but it's largely working and has the basics, so I'm happy to leave it as is for now.
